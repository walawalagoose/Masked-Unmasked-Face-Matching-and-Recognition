# Masked-Unmasked-Face-Matching-and-Recognition
This repository contains the source code for our group project "Masked Unmask Face Recognition," completed as part of the SWS2023_3026 _"Visual Computing"_ course at the School of Computing, National University of Singapore (NUS). This project was supervised by [Dr. Terence Sim](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/cs/people/tsim/), along with TAs Jiang Nan and Sun Bangjie.

The original project was divided into three levels: Beginner, Expert, and Bonus. This repository only includes the part for the Bonus Level, where I (walawalagoose) completed the model design, code implementation, and experiment setup independently.
